We are all surrounded by data, even when we don't know it we are being monitored and measured by a device. This can be 
your phone, your tv and even your fridge (if you have one of  those fridges with cameras and tablet in front). 

Now what happens to this data that are constantly being saved? Well they usually go to a company like Google or Facebook
to be then sold to other companies to gain money from ads and other profitable ways to target select group of people. 
But this is not a post complaining about "how we are all being montitored by the goverment" or some other paranoid way 
of thinking. 
This is about how I took control over this matter and instead of stop using these services I used the data that they all
collect and profit from and released it for free, to all people around the world.

## "Open" privacy
Here in Sweden we can get our hands on information that many countries deem as personal information such as where you live, 
what phone number you have, how much you earn etc.
We are accustomed to having access to certain information about our equals because we have grown up in a culture where
this is normal.

Now not everything is accessible  by everyone especially if you are underage or in a witness protection program(or similar).
But in general, certain information about you is always available to anyone.
With this model, privacy is not dead, you can still cheat on your wife without her knowing, well at least for a little while(they all find out eventually)
and you still feel safe and secure.

In a way to both be true to the "swedish model" of privacy and be as open to everyone around me as possible I have decided
to release as much information about myself in various forms. This will obviously exclude some type of data that may harm
me directly such as banking and credit card information but I will try and be as transparent as possible if data has been altered
or removed for certain reasons.

## Human data
The first release of my data will be "human data points", how much I walk each day, water consumption, amount of sleep etc.
This all being available to you with an interactive graph and dashboard over at [health.andreasbackstrom.se](https://health.andreasbackstrom.se)

This is mainly historical data, being updated every day. So the information that you can see over at the link above will be 
from yesterday and backwards in time starting from 2020-05-20 and hopefully a long time into the future.

The information that is shown on [health.andreasbackstrom.se](https://health.andreasbackstrom.se) is data collected from a
Fitbit Charge 3 that I wear almost all the time (except for when I shower) and the data is automatically retrieved from the Fitbit APIs and stored on
my servers at a daily basis. Nothing is removed or altered.

## The future
There is much more I  want to do but with so little time I have to priorities.
For know, [health.andreasbackstrom.se](https://health.andreasbackstrom.se) is setup to be fully automatic with little to no maintenance required
which will allow me to focus on other, similar projects.

**A (non exhaustive) list of data I want to collect and share:**

- Browser history
- Blood glucose levels 
- Location data (real time or historical)
- Watched TV shows and movies
- Probably much much more...

Thank you for reading. I will be writing about my future projects and ideas right here.
